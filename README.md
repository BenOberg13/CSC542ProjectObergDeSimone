# CSC542ProjectObergDeSimone
Ben Oberg and Michael De Simone's project about college basketball. I put the powerpoint in the docs file and the main file aswell. The data is pretty easy to access, You can click on each file and download them. Then it is the same way as you usually access a dataset in R. However, we combined all the datasets as seen in our source code.
